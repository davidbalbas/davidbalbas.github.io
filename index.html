<h2>David Balbás</h2>

<p> I am a first-year PhD student in Cryptography at IMDEA Software Institute in Madrid, advised by Prof. Dario Fiore and Prof. Maribel González-Vasco. I obtained a MSc in Computer Science (with a focus on theoretical computer science) at KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm.</p>
<p> I did my MSc Thesis at LASEC, EPFL in Lausanne, under the supervision of Prof. Serge Vaudenay and Daniel Collins. Previously, I completed a BSc in Mathematics and a BSc in Physics at Universidad de Cantabria, Spain. </p>

<h3> Interests </h3>

<p> My interests include cryptography, computer security, complexity theory and mathematics. Particularly, I am interested in group messaging, lattice-based cryptography, and verifiable computation. </p>
